# Calculator - Both Numerically and Alphabetically  

A calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with unique twist.

## Features

1. **Alphabetical Number Arrangement**  
   The number buttons are arranged alphabetically instead of the usual numeric keypad order.

2. **Number Position Mapping**  
   Each button represents its **alphabetical position** in the sequence:
   - `eight` → 0  
   - `five` → 1  ... and so on, until  
   - `zero` → 9
  
   - The actual order of the numbers/digits are the same as a standard calculator:  
  **7 8 9   
  4 5 6   
  1 2 3   
  < 0 .**

## How to Use

1. **Entering Numbers**
   - For `n` (1–9): Click the corresponding button `n` times.  
     Example: To enter "4", click the `"one"` button **4 times** (because `"one"` maps to `4`).
   - For `0`: Hover over the `"eight"` button for 1 second.

2. **Addition & Subtraction**
   - Click `+` or `-` as usual between numbers.

3. **Multiplication**
   - Use repeated addition.
   - Example: To compute `3 × 5` → enter `3`, then press `+` **5 times**.  
     Example: `3 × 5` → `3 + + + + +`

4. **Division**
   - Use repeated subtraction.
   - Example: To compute `12 / 4` → enter `12`, then press `-` **4 times**.  
     Example: `12 ÷ 4` → `12 - - - -`

5. **Division by Zero**
   - Shows `"Error"` in the display.
